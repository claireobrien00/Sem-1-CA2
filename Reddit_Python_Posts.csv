"Monday Morning Coffeeshop (May 20,2024)","The creek bottoms are too wet to plant still but we’re baling alfalfa today. Still have more to cut but the rains moving back in Wednesday. It’s been a hard fought season with all the rain in May. The wheat is maturing ahead of schedule. Won’t be long we’ll be baling hay, straw, and planting wheat beans."
"Grew up on 3,000 acres of southern Iowa cow/calf land... wish we still had it",Would take forever trying to work that much ground with that tractor
never knew that farming was this unprofitable and hard,Mercy of the weather and commodities. Parts and fuel prices are climbing and the world thinks we are trying to poison them.
Career change to farming? ,Go and ask. Obviously be polite and don't roll up looking like a chav drug dealer.  Naturally farmer's are a cautious lot so tread lightly. It doesn't cost anything too ask. Good luck.
Help please. Raccoon got in and I need to catch some hens,Netting in not a very good deterrent for predators. Even light chicken wike doesn't work well. I had coyotes tear through chicken wire and kill my turkeys. I had racoons pull ducks through chain link and eventually get in and out through the chain link ceiling. Gotta be more determined than the predators.
What’s happening to my chickens,"something that isn't big enough to kill it, but big enough to wound it.  rats, maybe.  other chickens.  

put a camera in your coop and see what you see.   a game camera is about $30-40 and can see in the dark."
Livestock for wildfire prevention; how to start? ,"Max your animal handling/care out first. As a retired firefighter I don’t see much cross over in a fire degree. Forestry management would be helpful,  but realistically you need to be able to manage a herd of goats 1st and foremost. Also you should figure out a plan for what the end goal for the goats are. Are you selling off the kids, butchering,  hair goats?  Just keeping a large herd for vegetation management won’t be very profitable as a stand alone."
Questions about nut trees ,"Either black walnut or pecan trees might do well for you in that area.  But you're looking at 20 or 30 years before you see any money from the nuts, and about 40 or 50 years before you have desirable hardwood trees to harvest.

There's always Christmas trees, but again, a decade or so before you see much return.

And I have no clue how fruit trees do in NE Texas.  Apples and peaches seem to be what the folks here in Mossouri focus on.  And again, several years before a harvest of any size.  I also understand that you have to know what you're doing to operate a successful orchard.

All that said, 22 acres of good brome hay, or alfalfa, will give you an income after a year or two. Takes a bit of work to get established but I make $75 to $100 an acre profit off my 50 acres of hillside pastures each year.  Mine are mixed Cowpro fescue, Orchard grass, and brome pastures with a little red clover here and there, that we sell to cattlemen in the area.

Prices vary from year to year quite a bit.  We do big squares (840 lbs.) that sell for $45 to $100 a bale, depending on the market.  Last two years have been dry as hell around here so we've gotten $80 to $100 a bale. This year we've had good rains so I expect we'll be closer to that $45/bale but we'll have lots to sell.

 If you want to maximize hay income, grow top quality hay (alfalfa or brome), small square bale it, and find the wealthy horse people to sell to.  They want it delivered and stacked in their barn. Don't sell on low price, sell quality."
UK farmers of Reddit what are the do's and don'ts of using public footpaths?,"Stick to the edge, in general, as it's the safest option when you can't recognise crop types, or the stage of growth when damage may be possible
Don't litter
Keep pets on leads

In general, think of it as someone's flower bed. Don't make a mess of it and you'll be fine in general"
Lease land,"Hay is the foundation of agriculture and the single most important crop grown worldwide. It also preserves your soils condition, and could be improving it depending on management methods. Approach the neighbor and tell him you would like to negotiate rent for him to continue having your land, or you will be advertising it for rent to any local farmer. If you like this neighbor and like how he treats your land, $50 per acre per year should keep both sides happy. It will pay your real estate tax on it and keep it in good condition. If he is somehow a burden to you, $150 per acre per year is the high side of hay rent and may discourage him from accepting.

All this being said, if you bring in someone who is going to be growing corn/soybeans, be prepared for the land to degrade quickly, and price accordingly."
Q: What are the tools used to transport crops for use on family farms?,Mostly helicopters
Has anyone ever used with seeder?,"I have one.  I think it could work for your intended purposes.  But I never thought about it ha.  I used it in my pasture.  For cow peas and sunflower seeds. 

It works about as good as can be expected. Would not work well for small seeds."
Fruity Farm TN,"And you’re just lawn mowing this? Oh it makes my hay and shepherd heart hurt lol. Advertise that crap. You’re in TN, I guarantee there are people who would make it into good hay or graze it, and even pay you rent for that (not a windfall, be aware cash rent for pasture/non-irrigated ground is not very high compared with rents for land being used for cash crops like corn)."
Lawn mower rec? Got 24 acres and need to cut the time in half,Fence it and graze livestock 
Ducks and Chickens ,My ducks always lay on the ground in the run or bottom of the coop. My chickens use the nesting boxes.
Is it worth paying attention to stocks in the controllable agricultural sector?,"Unless cost of production can be at or below traditional agriculture (through extended growing seasons), the economics of it only favor the harvesting of venture capital from people that don't understand agriculture."
What insect is this? I’m in western NC it’s on my crops ,"Soldier beetle. They’re a friend. They eat other bugs. 

If you want to learn more about pest/beneficial insect IDs, I recommend the Seek app. :) It’s free, the icon is green and looks like a leaf. You just kinda scan the bug (or plant) with your camera and it tells you what it is. I like it because you can even do things like scan a cluster of eggs on the underside of a leaf and it’ll tell you what kind of bug they’re going to become!"
Can anyone tell me what this is in the soil of my crop,"Appears to be bubble algae, I’ve never seen it on soil. Do they pop with liquid inside? Bubble algae is a single cell algae found in aquatic systems"
Can Modern Victory Gardens Enhance Traditional Farming Practices? Seeking Farmer Insights,"Wife and I watched a documentary on vertical gardening. It’s a fascinating concept, but it’s far cheaper to grow vegetables in the ground; vertical farming can’t compete."
What crop is this?,It's wheat...in western kentucky presently - all over the place
"Crop subsidy costs could surge 56% under House farm bill, say analysts",[deleted]
sunn hemp cover crop,It’s what I use on over 1000 acres. Only down fall is it doesn’t like wet areas.
Laughable Question in regard to Crocus Sativus,"I’m no expert but consider these points 
1 crocus bulbs won’t plant in a grain drill, corn planter, potato planter. Maybe whatever is used to plant garlic?
2 the crop is the stamen and pollen of a short crocus flower. From the dozen I was given it’s a really short harvest window, performed by hand.
3 the required crocus bulbs have a limited supply, I’d guess you’d be lucky to plant 1/2 an acre?
Best of luck and update us."
Double planted 25% of corn,"Location, Avg rainfall, seeding rate, fertility level and planned N rate?

That is a high amount of doubles, but it's probably not worth replanting as that would cost a lot more in time and seed than what your yield will be lowered. Probably.

If you are in an area of higher rainfall and your fertility is adequate then add some extra N as a side dress and it may surprise you."
How many cattle on 15 acres?,"Call your extension agent, ask them what stocking rate they recommend. We stock about 1 AU (animal unit) to 6-8 acres here and we are in the south with good native grass. We still feed hay in winter."
Does war increase the value of some crops?,"Supply and demand. If you plant more, supply goes up and prices drop. If a country that produces gets bombed a bunch and can’t produce, supply goes down and prices could go up. Raising production would level that out if matched."
What website do you recommend to see farmland prices in a specific part of a state?,"Local auction companies,  Sutton, Zomer and similar, FBN also has a tool that called a recent sale within a couple hundred per acre."
What are some plants (crops or weeds) that look similar to potato plants from a top view?,Tomatoes look very similar
What’s the best way to make the edges of chicken wire safer?,Update: the second and much longer side went much better thanks to y’all! So glad I stopped and asked before I just barreled forward with the rest.
AgOpenGps,"Yup, have it on a few tractors, even replaced some of my commercial name brand systems with AgOpenGPS.

My advise is: the stuff is so inexpensive compared to commercial GPS that you shouldn't try to cut corners or try to save even more money.

You can build a system that uses an old cordless drill welded to the steering column, a ride height sensor from the junkyard ziptied to the steering knuckle, and a Tupperware box taped to the dash full of re-used wiring spaghetti and some off-brand 5hz GPS receiver. Don't do that. That system will never be reliable and will be a nightmare to troubleshoot. You can afford to do better. There's the Russians on YouTube who have set up their Belarus like this, don't be like them.

Go buy the nice oil/high temp rated automotive wire, sleeve it. Go get the nice crimpers and use proper name brand electrical connectors. Go buy a hydraulic valve. Go buy/build an All-In-One board and ublox receivers. It will cost you $3k per tractor, but then you don't have to touch it again and it just works all the time.

My other advise is: lightbars suck and not having RTK sucks."
Unprofitable egg farm,"Can they buy feed in bulk? 2000 pounds, instead of 50 pound bags? 

My chickens free range and eat all the bugs and worms, mice, snakes, fresh greens/grass that they want. I also throw grass clippings, mulch, kitchen scraps, food pantry leftovers, etc. no problem.

How about the tailings of a feed mill or remnants from other produce processing? (Fruit peels, seed hulls, etc.)

I only have 20-50 birds at a time."
Fallow ground moisture conservation,"Even with a fallow year, you are out on the far edge of possible.

Lind Research Station run by Washington State University  does research on low rainfall dryland agriculture.  

Horse Heaven Hills in Southern Washington at 8"" a year is the lowest rainfall dryland wheat production area I'm familiar with.

Good luck."
Contract Grazing,"I’m paying $0.17/cwt/day to get some calves grazed.  I’m providing the minerals. He is providing the grass, fence, water.  We didn’t discuss chute fees or anything like that.  I’d obviously be responsible for and meds/supplies if needed.  It’s a handshake deal with a semi-retired guy.  He used to buy some calves to background but I convinced him it would be better to just take my guaranteed money. 

Have a buddy charging $0.18/cwt/day for dry cows.  

Both in Virginia"
What crops are worth it in Upstate NY?,Chestnuts. As it looks like the modified American Chestnut is still having the kinks worked out it will have to be a Hybrid Chestnut.
Spontaneous Combustion,"Not a little pile like that one.  The breakdown of cellulose hastened by the nitrogen in the poultry litter releases energy in the form of heat but it won't get hot enough to combust.  Add pressure and a source of oxygen to a million ton (!!!) pile and the odds get greater.  Then again, there is some possibility I will win Lotto tomorrow night..."
Can I Feed My Cows Green Wheat? ,Spread it out and make sure 1 cow doesn't eat more than her share. Green wheat is fine in moderation. To be safe start at 1% of the cows body weight per day and move up from there. After 3 days go to 2% and so on. Just remember that if the wheat is still in its grain fill stage there won't be a lot of fiber and that's what gets you in trouble. If there isn't a lot of wheat to begin with then just stay at that 1-2% range.
Grazing livestock on cropland pays off,"This is the first year I put Rye out in the fields around my pasture and can tell you it's made a world of difference in my spring staging season 

Besides nutrition and soil health benefits there's also health benefits of moving the herd through a cover crop vs feeding in a dry lot or sacrifice paddock until pasture turnout

My sacrifice paddock is a huge carrier of coccidia and last year had to treat 30 calves but with rotating through the rye I only had to treat 2 calves early on plus let two symptomatic ones naturally cure because I was moving into a fresh field 

Another thing is you can mob graze that stuff to nothing right before planting and you may not even need to terminate if planting corn back into it like we're trying this year"
Anyone work extremely hilly ground ?,Look up Palouse wheat harvest in WA state.
Milking in a squeeze chute,"Gotta watch your arms. They can still kick while in the chute, and between her hoof and a steel pipe, your hand and arm can get snapped. I’ve had to do the same on some cows, to get the baby up and going. I’ve had to tie one leg back to keep from getting kicked.

Is the trying to get away a new thing? Or is she trying to see her new calf while she’s getting milked? Have you tried putting the calf right next to her while in the head gate, so she can see and smell it?"
Farmer walking around at night with cowbell,"Probably looking for a cow or two that broke out from the fencing. Cows will hear the bell and come towards it.

Or he could be a serial killer."
"Looking at buying this tractor for 4 acres, Summit tractor",For four acres why not purchase an older less expensive tractor? You can buy a whole fleet of antique farmall for the price of one new summit.

How do you stay positive?,"Gotta be thankful for what you have. I’ve got some good ground, some good cows, and have everything paid for at the moment. Kids are coming of age to help, too. There are seasons in life just like seasons in farming. And some years are wet, while others are dry. Don’t let the day to day stress rob you of your joy."
Broiler Farming best practices,"Not sure where you're at or what scale you're talking about, but I have a 12 house farm in GA. 

Read your controller's manual a bunch. It's easy to lose birds due to not having a table set up right.  Keep waterlines and feeders high. Cull hard and often. Dry floors are super important.  Check out the Poultry 411 app from UGA and use the minimum ventilation calculator, especially in the winter.  Use windspeed to cool birds, not your cool cells.  Cool cells are the last resort.  Read research papers from [https://www.poultryventilation.com/](https://www.poultryventilation.com/) (also from UGA). Watch your service rep post birds and learn how to do it yourself.

  
I've made a failed subreddit r/poultry_growers feel free to join.  I'm there, but no one else is haha."
AIing cows is damn hard,"AI is all about repetition. Every cow is different, but the process and the parts are all the same. Find a routine and process that works for you and do it over and over.  I did professional AI work for over 3 years and was lucky to get some great training but would still say it took a couple hundred services before I was confident that I could get through any cow put in front of me.


Pro tip: work the cervix over the gun, not the gun through the cervix"
Does anyone have any way to get a nurse cow to stop kicking,"Hobble her front and back legs together. 

Put her in a chute, get some good rope, and tie her front and back legs together. Loose enough she can walk, but not enough slack to kick."
Life after Dairy… ,There is life after cows.
Looking for some Hay cutting advice,"We had a new idea 5209 9 ft…had the first one in our neighborhood which is certainly not like us as we farmed like it was 1960…bought new and serviced every year for almost 20 years…that cut faster then neighbor with the 12ft 499 haybine…then a new Massey we had for two years before we sold the cows.  Both were great units…like anything maintenance is the key and buying used is a roll of the dice but certainly more cost friendly.  We always chased the mower with an old hay conditioner… the xtra crimping gained us a 1/2 day or full day of dry down for making small squares…old conditioners are cheap, but hard to find…the condition of the rollers on the used machines is worth considering when shopping around…rocks are little more of a problem with the discbine, can cause more damage to the machine, tractor, and a danger to you as the operator…nothing is better if you’re cutting a heavy crop or a crop that gets blown down and tangled by t-storms etc…the do make smaller ones now that are side mount to the tractor with no conditioner too…like smaller versions of the front and two side mowers the big shots use around here for hay-in-a-day for bunkers or even ballage etc.  just a couple thoughts…Way more rambling than you want but I loved cutting hay and talking farming, sorry.  Good luck."

"Too many tractors: As boom times fade, farm equipment piles up",How much you wanna bet that price won't reflect oversupply with a lot of new machines that'll sit for years at the same price or a couple 10s knocked off
"What’s a hourly wage for someone with over 6 years experience planting with a 16 row John Deere 1720 and tractor with gps.  This would include providing technical support to other tractors gps as well as loading fertilizer, seed, checking seed depth, and maintaining the equipment.","Seasonal or year around?  To me, that makes a difference. 

I’ve hired seasonal guys before to help at harvest.  I’m out of the farming game currently, but I would pay my cousin and another guy $20 an hour plus free gas, provide meals and beer. They both loved it as it was a side gig and I think they felt like they didn’t have any cost in helping me, ie, making lunches, driving 20 miles each way, etc. 

They had experience, and at the end of the season, I’m not going to miss 200 gallons of gas out of the bulk tank. Plus, we were already cooking for 4 people, so what’s two more as far as meals.

IMO, the hourly money is only part of it. Getting creative with compensation and giving employees (who earned) trust and responsibilities seems to go a long ways."
What crops end up getting dumped instead of sold? ,"In 2015 I had 2500 acres of winter wheat that ran in the 90s… it rained all July and early august.  Ruined all of it, falling numbers etc. Elevators wouldnt take it.  …. Crop insurance paid me out on it, didn’t offer me any ideas on what to do with it.  Had to harvest it.  
I mixed some into the silage pile, bought grain burning stoves for all the buildings, even bought some for my friends just to get rid of 50-60 bu of that fucking shit here and there. Barely made a dent, 200-230,000 bushels of pig shit.    Put ads out that I’d haul it to you for free if you’d take a load.  
the next spring I bought a fertilizer spreader and blew all of it out onto soybean ground as if it were fertilizer.   At least 400lbs an acre.  
Still had a bunch left.   Started dumping it in ditches.  

Haven’t grown winter wheat since.   Left a bad taste in my mouth."
"Iowa cattle feedlot's manure pollution apparently went undetected for years, DNR says","Well so much for staying off radar being under the manure management threshold 

It really sucks we've been operating the same lots for generations with field tile that drains from the home property and even feedlots during heavy rains 

It's small cuts like these that kill mid sized cattle farms like mine who've been operating generations

Edit: did some looking into it and found the location on satellite which now I understand better why the DNR is involved 

It looks like  there's two confinement barns and can see a small lagoon, pond, shithole that's got runoff from there into the field"
Agricultural spraying drones from Alibaba?,"When you were chatting with them, did you verify that the price quoted was for a complete, fully-functional drone with all pieces and components? The first link could be interpreted to be just for the pump and the second link just for an ""engine"".

Also, some sellers will display an absurdly low price to get your attention and then charge $10,000 shipping. When you get your pump or engine and then complain that you didn't get what you ordered, they refund the item price-but shipping is non-refundable. 

There a definitely good deals to be had but trust your gut and know that alibaba and similar are barely walking the scam line."
‘Nonexistent subsoil moisture’ and stripe rust challenging Kansas winter wheat,"I mean, what’s “nonexistent”? 7” in 4 ft is great for us. Obviously soil type plays a lot in to this, but I’d be curious to see some actual qualitative data on this."
"Former USDA Under Secretary for Food Safety says Negative Beef Tests for H5N1 Came as ""No Surprise""","From the OP article:

""""Really your meat is essentially sterile.  That’s the muscle of the animal and this virus you usually find in the GI tract or in the respiratory system.  So, I was not surprised that they didn’t find any in the meat products.""""


It's not because the cows didn't have it, it just wouldn't be in the muscle."
Is it worth it anymore ,Budget and find efficiencies.  You need to do internal reflection on what parts are making you money vs not.  Can you sell any feed?  Can you do meat birds?  Can you sell your mechanical services?  Rent out your tractor?

How would a change in subsidies affect you?,"SNAP has been subsidizing farmers markets and produce for 6 or 7 years now. It could be streamlined better, but it's there. That being said.. most vegetables are labor intensive with a short shelf life. If everyone went for broke and worried more about growing food than money, maybe. But as it stands, most farms don't have that kind of man power."
"Do men even want to be a smaller scale farmer at all? I keep finding big farmer/ing topics ,but none of the smaller regenerative farming fans that are actually male. Would be interesting to get an opinion.","I am a small scale farmer focused on regenerative agriculture and biodynamic farming and it is extremely tricky to turn a profit. I think in general many farmers are open to the idea regardless of sex, but the costs and risks of transitioning play a large factor in why people choose not to. There’s a Regenerative Agriculture Podcast on Spotify that I enjoy listening to and the guests he has on the show don’t seem to be primarily one sex or the other so I never quite noticed what you are seeing and most, if not all, of the organic farmers in my area are male. There’s also a great permaculture farm not far from us (they do a lot of garlic) also a guy running it. One of the most successful small scale biodynamic farms about an hour away from us is headed up by a former Ag professor who is super into soil microbiomes who is also male so… I guess it depends on your location?"
Ranch/farm hand start?,"What can you bring to the table? Not familiar with anyone who would need help with goats really; unless you can find a large scale feedlot or niche business. Cattle are more common (or sheep in certain areas) and even then you generally need to be an all around hand — fencing, driving machines and feed trucks, feedlot/pen riding, etc.

Depends heavily on your location and what you can offer."

Crops to grazing land,"Grass is just another crop.  Get a soil test to see what the soil is like now, figure out if you want to amend it to be better to grow grass, plant grass.   It's possible to find people to do all of the work if you pay them for it. 

if you're talking about letting the ground go fallow and then animals eating whatever happens to grow, I'd avoid that.  First, you may grow stuff that your animals find unpalatable, or you might grow some good stuff and some bad, and your animals will graze off the good stuff and leave only the bad, so by this time next year you're mostly bad.  

figure out what kind of forage grows well in your area by talking to your local conservation district and they can probably recommend people to do the work that you're not equipped to do."

Most of these guys operations struggle from not being around to check cows, or not being able to seed or spray in a timely manner because of their day job.

"Farmer, Amy Veteran Killed In Bull Attack: Officials","Cattle, livestock in general, are dangerous. Don’t get complacent, stay safe out there guys"
Question on water reels,"I would run the traveler down the outside using a part circle gun. Assuming you have the gpm and psi to cover the field. With the right gun and nozzle combination and the the traveler offset a bit from the row you should easily clear that height. If you want to go down the middle you would need a traveler and riser combination  to clear the corn. A good 4 wheel traveler will not fall over and will be sized for the gun on it. 

I’d consider 2” hose as minimum for a 300’ set to avoid huge pressure losses, especially if you run on the outside of the field and a much larger throw. In the middle you could get away with smaller gpm/psi and hose. Just need to check the psi loss charts for distance based on your pump curve and gun/nozzle combination. You might need to run a smaller nozzle and run the retrieval speed slower to compensate for the lower gpm so you get enough water on the crop. 

Check out Nelson reels and guns."
Farmland prices diverge at the border,"If they wanted a Canadian example they coulda looked here. Our lands trading for around 7500-10000 depending on quality and which neighbours are fighting. Across the river in Québec it’s 3000-5000. Part of it is land quality. They run more to sand and sour ground the bigger part is government policy and language. The religious and language laws mean the Mennonites don’t move there and the laws restricting who can buy land means no one moves from here over to there. Our land took a hell of a jump when guys moved up from southern Ontario they don’t seem to get the same jump from people coming from the Montreal area. The interprovincial barriers on vets and other services really restricts  access and that cuts down on land demand even more. Land quality wise they can’t get guys to drain land unless they have Quebec qualifications either so you either are big enough to have your own rig, on the wait list for there to be enough jobs that justify the French guys from down below to come up or it just doesn’t get done."
Looking for a tractor,"I never understand why the replies to these posts are always new from your closest dealer. I would never so much as consider new when you can get twice the tractor for half the money used, especially in the case of hobby farming. Is everyone afraid of basic maintenance? It's very easy to learn the common issues and what to check for on any specific model you're looking at. Downtime doesn't cost alot when it's 7 goats and a few pigs, its not 3000 acres to seed with rain in the forecast.
If it was me, I'd look at a Ford 5000 or similar, the 4600 -7600 as well as the ten 10 series are excellent and reliable utility tractors.  A massey 275 would get the job done with a Perkins diesel.
Instead of dropping 60k or more on a new 5 series John Deere and eating the expensive early hours depreciation, you could spend 30 on something with 100 hp and a cab and 8 on a backup just as capable but a bit less comfortable then the new deere. Neither of which will depreciate from the hours a hobbyist puts on"

Small cattle operation help,"Going to a custom feedlot you’re going to need enough to fill a pen, it could be 100 head, 300 head or more. They’ll charge you daily yardage, feed & veterinary expenses. Make sure you buy them right."
Why not cover crop and no till ,"Where I live we no till because we have to keep moisture in the ground. It’s our biggest limiting factor that contributes to yields. If we tilled we would have a dust bowl and no moisture in fields. 

I can’t speak for other places like Iowa or Minnesota but I would imagine their soils hold moisture so well that they would never get anything planted if they didn’t turn their dirt. Also allows the soil to warm up I’d imagine. When they take off their 200 bushel corn that leaves a lot of residue covering the ground. That would make it basically impossible to get a good stand and even just getting a tractor and planter in the field without it being too wet. Basically the opposite problem we have out west. 

Treating every regions farm ground across the country the same just simply doesn’t work. Climates and soil types limit what can be done. Not saying no till wouldn’t work in the corn belt, but I don’t know. I certainly don’t know better than the guys who have farmed that ground for generations."

Retail Prices at Farmer's Markets,"You will go broke attempting to compete against grocery stores on price alone. You (and anyone selling at a farmers market) should be selling on higher quality and nutrient density, not on price. 

Would a person ever walk in to a Cadillac dealership and complain to them about the price of their vehicles, and that they can go buy a Kia or a Hyundai for a quarter of the price? And would that cause the Cadillac dealer to adjust their prices? 

People will pay more for a higher quality product. If you are growing the produce, you are selling a Cadillac, not a Kia. 

If they want a Kia tomato that tastes more like cardboard that's a tomato, they can go to the grocery store. But if they want a Cadillac tomato that actually has flavor, they can buy it from you. 

Compete on quality, not on price.

If you grew it, you should be getting 20-50% above grocery store prices. You should never be lower than the grocery store. Because you're not selling swill."

1910 Census of Agriculture  
Chapter 9.  
FARMS AND FARM PROPERTY  
See footnote 2 Land in Farms at the bottom of Chapter 9, Page 1 provided below for your convenience.

Land In farms. - Land In farms ls divided at the present census Into (I) improved land, (2) woodland, and (3) all other unimproved land. The same classification was followed in 1880. At former censuses, except that of 1880, farm land was divided Into improved land and unimproved land, woodland being included with unimproved land. Improved land includes all land regularly tilled or mowed, land pastured and cropped in rotation, land lying fallow, land in gardens, orchards, vineyards, and nurseries, and land occupied by farm buildings. Woodland Includes all land covered with natural or planted forest trees which produce, or later may produce, firewood or other forest products. All other unimproved land includes brush land, rough or stony land, swamp land, and any other land which Is not  improved or In forest. It should be noted, however, in this connotation that the Census classification of farm land as ""improved land,'' ""woodland,'' and ""other unimproved land"" is one not always easy for the farmers or enumerators to make, owing to the fact that the farmers sometimes use these terms with different meanings from those assigned to them by the Bureau of the Census. There Is evidence that the same kind of land has at certain times and places been reported as ""Improved land'' and at other times and places as"" unimproved land,'' rendering these classifications less accurate than the report of total farm acreage and  value."
"Two men jailed in Pennsylvania for cow ultrasounds, attorney claims they are being held illegally","Unfortunate situation.  I guess any resulting legal challenges will be based on what constitutes vet care.  They could structure their business such that they are providing training to producers in ultrasound methods rather than ultrasound services.

Would love to see what they're batting compared to vets in their first 5 years of practice,second 5, or second decade. 

I think previous episodes were chalked up to the price of doing business and that the state had no intentions of pressing the matter.  As you say, they fcked around for more than a decade and found out.  We'll see where this one goes.  How much money do they have to throw at it, really."
Do you think you’ll be able to keep up with future technology?,"You don't always have to upgrade tech. You can't still grow a good crop with yesterday's tech. Most guys are just using gps as guidance. Some are still using it for mapping and a light bar. I personally just use guidance as I can't afford the equipment to fully utilize the latest and greatest. And when I can afford it, it will be yesterday's tech again.  My crops are just as big as the next guys with newer stuff.


You are also much more equipped to use the new tech vs what your grandpa was.  Technology is ever changing and upgrading around you everyday and you have access to Google."
A farming technique I was thinking about,The real problem here is that you obviously have no idea how farming works. For 90%+ of all crops harvested the plant has lived its “full life cycle”. People will treat you like an idiot here because you have not even taken the time to read a Wikipedia article about how plants grow and how farming works. I wish you the best.
Tractor Supply CEO says there’s still ‘significant migration’ out of urban areas,"Tractor Supply is unfortunately the only ""farm supply"" retailer in my area and it kills me that they're turning into a homegoods and fashion clothing store :(  They are still a good go-to for some livestock supplies and equipment but more than half of their floor space is stuff that also can be found at Home Depot or Wal-Mart.  Why they would try to compete with Wal-Mart and have 3 aisles dedicated to dog and cat foot and toys I cannot comprehend.  

I'm afraid they'll be out of business in a few years then I'll be really screwed."

Wanting to get into agriculture ,"I’ll share a little of my background. Grew up a city kid and hated it but couldn’t really find a way out of the city. I got really into hunting and through that learned a tiny bit about ag. Basically what crop fields whitetails, pheasants and geese preferred. With some guidance from a mentor in ag who also had a similar background, I learned you don’t have to inherit a family farm to work in ag. At 25 I went back to school and got the change of scenery I needed at an Oregon community college with a small ag program. I transferred to Oregon State and got a BS in agronomy. I’ve now been working in the ag world 15 years, and as an agronomist for 11 of those, first in seed production and now precision ag. I met lifelong best friends in college, we helped each other kick ass in school and we all have been working in agronomy. Our group chat has potato disease pictures, wheat yields, soil temperatures, all kinds of things we bounce off each other. I’m not rich and I don’t have my own farm but I also still love hunting in October and November and fishing in April and May, which many farmers don’t have the time for. So that’s what I did, anyone with the motivation can do the same. You may go a different route or end up in a different field, that’s more than ok, but if you want to work in agriculture I recommend a bachelors degree. I use my degree every day and it has opened pretty much all the doors I’ve had in front of me. Plenty of people could have ended up in the same spot as me with no college, but without growing up around it I needed it. So I’m very pro-ag school!"

Bumper pull trailer,"Trailer prices have been insanely high since Covid. For whatever reason, idk, but we’ve been actively looking to purchase several different types of livestock trailers since 2020 and the prices shot through the roof. The only thing I could figure is because of that stimulus money burning holes in pockets. Rusted out livestock trailers were/are selling for $1,500-$2,500. You’d be lucky to get $200 for them in scrap.

I wouldn’t be surprised if that trailer is listed north of $3500."

"Monday Morning Coffeeshop (April 22, 2024)",There’s always people who talk about how a young person can’t start farming. Well they need to come to here and meet a buddy of mine. He started milking for a guy in highschool and over the years has built up a beef and cash crop operation with rented land and equipment. Bought a farm last year now he’s putting in for quota. Plan is to gut the old beef barn for a freestall and slap a parlour or a robot on the front. It’s reminder that sometimes if you’re bullheaded enough you can do what they say can’t be done
Do I need a license or something related to that to raise chicken for myself as food on my property? I live in Canada,Chickens for personal use aren’t covered under the marketing boards in Ontario so no licence required. You can raise 300 meat birds per year or have up to 100 laying hens. You can sell eggs but to sell meat birds they’d have to be killed at an inspected plant
Do you ever keep animals you love after they can’t be productive anymore,"productivity comes in multiple forms, we had a sweet old cow that knew all the fences and gates for pasture rotations, she would be the first to start walking when we whistled. she showed all the young ones how easy it was to get to new grass. She hadn't had a calf for a few seasons but she earned her winter hay many times over by making every move easy. I still miss her."
Small Flower Farm - Machinery Decision,"You need to look at the ROI to see if buying is worth it. Don’t forget maintenance costs. Also make sure to consider everything you will and won’t do with the equipment if you buy it. There are probably a lot more things you will use a good tractor for than you can think of. If it is going to sit for months at a time to just be used for a few hours than maybe renting is a better deal. Assuming you can get the rental when you need it.

"Mini round balers, pros and cons?","I'd personally go for an older small square baler, or larger round baler. You could probably get multiple for the price of a new small baler, they will have more parts support, and have better capacity.

Christmas Tree Farm,"Lot of work. Lot of issues but it can pay. You’ve gotta have a market and be able to compete with big growers and big box stores bringing them in by the rail car load. Many people think Christmas trees are an easy “plant and come back in 7 years and collect money” deal but that’s not the case. Like all farming it’s a lot of work with nutrient, irrigation and pest issues. You should turn the bulk of a crop in 6 to 7 years. 

We did retail Christmas trees for 20 years and finally gave up and moved to being a wholesale nursery. Much less hassle, no major work in crappy winter weather and no public to deal with."

NJ Used Tractors ,"Used equipment os sky high in price and especially so here in the Northeast. There simply are not as many farms around so less equipment up for sale. What does go for sale is at a premium if in good shape. 

You need to define smaller end. For some people that means under 200hp and for others it’s 10hp. Depending on what features you want you might need to expand your search area. What you intend to farm and the land you have will guide your choice. 

Whatever you buy make sure to inspect it well mechanically  and test drive for function testing. It is well worth the cost of paying a mechanic for a inspection if you are not certain of your ability to inspect it. 

General guidelines. Avoid “spray can overhauls”, if it has real low hours and looks like crap, it’s been beat and pass it up. I’d rather buy high hours and good maintenance. A ROPS cab is a good thing, especially if you have no tractor experience."
Can grass-fed beef be given grain for 50% of its diet?,Grass fed is not the same and grass finished
never knew that farming was this unprofitable and hard,"You sell the exact same product as everybody else, so the only way to make money is to produce more of it. Every farmer tries to produce more to make more money. That increases supply, causing commodity prices to go down… in a nutshell. That’s without the cost of machinery and the interest on loans that are typically required to purchase machinery and land."

Livestock for wildfire prevention; how to start? ,"Max your animal handling/care out first. As a retired firefighter I don’t see much cross over in a fire degree. Forestry management would be helpful,  but realistically you need to be able to manage a herd of goats 1st and foremost. Also you should figure out a plan for what the end goal for the goats are. Are you selling off the kids, butchering,  hair goats?  Just keeping a large herd for vegetation management won’t be very profitable as a stand alone."
Questions about nut trees ,"Either black walnut or pecan trees might do well for you in that area.  But you're looking at 20 or 30 years before you see any money from the nuts, and about 40 or 50 years before you have desirable hardwood trees to harvest.

There's always Christmas trees, but again, a decade or so before you see much return.

And I have no clue how fruit trees do in NE Texas.  Apples and peaches seem to be what the folks here in Mossouri focus on.  And again, several years before a harvest of any size.  I also understand that you have to know what you're doing to operate a successful orchard.

All that said, 22 acres of good brome hay, or alfalfa, will give you an income after a year or two. Takes a bit of work to get established but I make $75 to $100 an acre profit off my 50 acres of hillside pastures each year.  Mine are mixed Cowpro fescue, Orchard grass, and brome pastures with a little red clover here and there, that we sell to cattlemen in the area.

Prices vary from year to year quite a bit.  We do big squares (840 lbs.) that sell for $45 to $100 a bale, depending on the market.  Last two years have been dry as hell around here so we've gotten $80 to $100 a bale. This year we've had good rains so I expect we'll be closer to that $45/bale but we'll have lots to sell.

 If you want to maximize hay income, grow top quality hay (alfalfa or brome), small square bale it, and find the wealthy horse people to sell to.  They want it delivered and stacked in their barn. Don't sell on low price, sell quality."
What’s happening to my chickens,"something that isn't big enough to kill it, but big enough to wound it.  rats, maybe.  other chickens.  

put a camera in your coop and see what you see.   a game camera is about $30-40 and can see in the dark."
Lease land,"Hay is the foundation of agriculture and the single most important crop grown worldwide. It also preserves your soils condition, and could be improving it depending on management methods. Approach the neighbor and tell him you would like to negotiate rent for him to continue having your land, or you will be advertising it for rent to any local farmer. If you like this neighbor and like how he treats your land, $50 per acre per year should keep both sides happy. It will pay your real estate tax on it and keep it in good condition. If he is somehow a burden to you, $150 per acre per year is the high side of hay rent and may discourage him from accepting.

All this being said, if you bring in someone who is going to be growing corn/soybeans, be prepared for the land to degrade quickly, and price accordingly."

That is a high amount of doubles, but it's probably not worth replanting as that would cost a lot more in time and seed than what your yield will be lowered. Probably.

AgOpenGps,"Yup, have it on a few tractors, even replaced some of my commercial name brand systems with AgOpenGPS.

My advise is: the stuff is so inexpensive compared to commercial GPS that you shouldn't try to cut corners or try to save even more money.

You can build a system that uses an old cordless drill welded to the steering column, a ride height sensor from the junkyard ziptied to the steering knuckle, and a Tupperware box taped to the dash full of re-used wiring spaghetti and some off-brand 5hz GPS receiver. Don't do that. That system will never be reliable and will be a nightmare to troubleshoot. You can afford to do better. There's the Russians on YouTube who have set up their Belarus like this, don't be like them.

Go buy the nice oil/high temp rated automotive wire, sleeve it. Go get the nice crimpers and use proper name brand electrical connectors. Go buy a hydraulic valve. Go buy/build an All-In-One board and ublox receivers. It will cost you $3k per tractor, but then you don't have to touch it again and it just works all the time.

My other advise is: lightbars suck and not having RTK sucks."

Can I Feed My Cows Green Wheat? ,Spread it out and make sure 1 cow doesn't eat more than her share. Green wheat is fine in moderation. To be safe start at 1% of the cows body weight per day and move up from there. After 3 days go to 2% and so on. Just remember that if the wheat is still in its grain fill stage there won't be a lot of fiber and that's what gets you in trouble. If there isn't a lot of wheat to begin with then just stay at that 1-2% range.

Grazing livestock on cropland pays off,"This is the first year I put Rye out in the fields around my pasture and can tell you it's made a world of difference in my spring staging season 

Besides nutrition and soil health benefits there's also health benefits of moving the herd through a cover crop vs feeding in a dry lot or sacrifice paddock until pasture turnout

My sacrifice paddock is a huge carrier of coccidia and last year had to treat 30 calves but with rotating through the rye I only had to treat 2 calves early on plus let two symptomatic ones naturally cure because I was moving into a fresh field 

Another thing is you can mob graze that stuff to nothing right before planting and you may not even need to terminate if planting corn back into it like we're trying this year"

Read your controller's manual a bunch. It's easy to lose birds due to not having a table set up right.  Keep waterlines and feeders high. Cull hard and often. Dry floors are super important.  Check out the Poultry 411 app from UGA and use the minimum ventilation calculator, especially in the winter.  Use windspeed to cool birds, not your cool cells.  Cool cells are the last resort.  Read research papers from [https://www.poultryventilation.com/](https://www.poultryventilation.com/) (also from UGA). Watch your service rep post birds and learn how to do it yourself.

Looking for some Hay cutting advice,"We had a new idea 5209 9 ft…had the first one in our neighborhood which is certainly not like us as we farmed like it was 1960…bought new and serviced every year for almost 20 years…that cut faster then neighbor with the 12ft 499 haybine…then a new Massey we had for two years before we sold the cows.  Both were great units…like anything maintenance is the key and buying used is a roll of the dice but certainly more cost friendly.  We always chased the mower with an old hay conditioner… the xtra crimping gained us a 1/2 day or full day of dry down for making small squares…old conditioners are cheap, but hard to find…the condition of the rollers on the used machines is worth considering when shopping around…rocks are little more of a problem with the discbine, can cause more damage to the machine, tractor, and a danger to you as the operator…nothing is better if you’re cutting a heavy crop or a crop that gets blown down and tangled by t-storms etc…the do make smaller ones now that are side mount to the tractor with no conditioner too…like smaller versions of the front and two side mowers the big shots use around here for hay-in-a-day for bunkers or even ballage etc.  just a couple thoughts…Way more rambling than you want but I loved cutting hay and talking farming, sorry.  Good luck."

Agricultural spraying drones from Alibaba?,"When you were chatting with them, did you verify that the price quoted was for a complete, fully-functional drone with all pieces and components? The first link could be interpreted to be just for the pump and the second link just for an ""engine"".

Also, some sellers will display an absurdly low price to get your attention and then charge $10,000 shipping. When you get your pump or engine and then complain that you didn't get what you ordered, they refund the item price-but shipping is non-refundable. 

There a definitely good deals to be had but trust your gut and know that alibaba and similar are barely walking the scam line."

This would include providing technical support to other tractors gps as well as loading fertilizer, seed, checking seed depth, and maintaining the equipment.","Seasonal or year around?  To me, that makes a difference. 

I’ve hired seasonal guys before to help at harvest.  I’m out of the farming game currently, but I would pay my cousin and another guy $20 an hour plus free gas, provide meals and beer. They both loved it as it was a side gig and I think they felt like they didn’t have any cost in helping me, ie, making lunches, driving 20 miles each way, etc. 

They had experience, and at the end of the season, I’m not going to miss 200 gallons of gas out of the bulk tank. Plus, we were already cooking for 4 people, so what’s two more as far as meals.

IMO, the hourly money is only part of it. Getting creative with compensation and giving employees (who earned) trust and responsibilities seems to go a long ways."

What crops end up getting dumped instead of sold? ,"In 2015 I had 2500 acres of winter wheat that ran in the 90s… it rained all July and early august.  Ruined all of it, falling numbers etc. Elevators wouldnt take it.  …. Crop insurance paid me out on it, didn’t offer me any ideas on what to do with it.  Had to harvest it.  
I mixed some into the silage pile, bought grain burning stoves for all the buildings, even bought some for my friends just to get rid of 50-60 bu of that fucking shit here and there. Barely made a dent, 200-230,000 bushels of pig shit.    Put ads out that I’d haul it to you for free if you’d take a load.  
the next spring I bought a fertilizer spreader and blew all of it out onto soybean ground as if it were fertilizer.   At least 400lbs an acre.  
Still had a bunch left.   Started dumping it in ditches.  

Haven’t grown winter wheat since.   Left a bad taste in my mouth."

It's small cuts like these that kill mid sized cattle farms like mine who've been operating generations

"Do men even want to be a smaller scale farmer at all? I keep finding big farmer/ing topics ,but none of the smaller regenerative farming fans that are actually male. Would be interesting to get an opinion.","I am a small scale farmer focused on regenerative agriculture and biodynamic farming and it is extremely tricky to turn a profit. I think in general many farmers are open to the idea regardless of sex, but the costs and risks of transitioning play a large factor in why people choose not to. There’s a Regenerative Agriculture Podcast on Spotify that I enjoy listening to and the guests he has on the show don’t seem to be primarily one sex or the other so I never quite noticed what you are seeing and most, if not all, of the organic farmers in my area are male. There’s also a great permaculture farm not far from us (they do a lot of garlic) also a guy running it. One of the most successful small scale biodynamic farms about an hour away from us is headed up by a former Ag professor who is super into soil microbiomes who is also male so… I guess it depends on your location?"
How would a change in subsidies affect you?,"SNAP has been subsidizing farmers markets and produce for 6 or 7 years now. It could be streamlined better, but it's there. That being said.. most vegetables are labor intensive with a short shelf life. If everyone went for broke and worried more about growing food than money, maybe. But as it stands, most farms don't have that kind of man power."
Ranch/farm hand start?,"What can you bring to the table? Not familiar with anyone who would need help with goats really; unless you can find a large scale feedlot or niche business. Cattle are more common (or sheep in certain areas) and even then you generally need to be an all around hand — fencing, driving machines and feed trucks, feedlot/pen riding, etc.

Depends heavily on your location and what you can offer."

Crops to grazing land,"Grass is just another crop.  Get a soil test to see what the soil is like now, figure out if you want to amend it to be better to grow grass, plant grass.   It's possible to find people to do all of the work if you pay them for it. 

if you're talking about letting the ground go fallow and then animals eating whatever happens to grow, I'd avoid that.  First, you may grow stuff that your animals find unpalatable, or you might grow some good stuff and some bad, and your animals will graze off the good stuff and leave only the bad, so by this time next year you're mostly bad.  

figure out what kind of forage grows well in your area by talking to your local conservation district and they can probably recommend people to do the work that you're not equipped to do."
Combining farming w/ full time job,"My dad ran the bank in town for 30 years while farming.  Ran the living piss out of himself doing it.

Most of these guys operations struggle from not being around to check cows, or not being able to seed or spray in a timely manner because of their day job.

Question on water reels,"I would run the traveler down the outside using a part circle gun. Assuming you have the gpm and psi to cover the field. With the right gun and nozzle combination and the the traveler offset a bit from the row you should easily clear that height. If you want to go down the middle you would need a traveler and riser combination  to clear the corn. A good 4 wheel traveler will not fall over and will be sized for the gun on it. 

I’d consider 2” hose as minimum for a 300’ set to avoid huge pressure losses, especially if you run on the outside of the field and a much larger throw. In the middle you could get away with smaller gpm/psi and hose. Just need to check the psi loss charts for distance based on your pump curve and gun/nozzle combination. You might need to run a smaller nozzle and run the retrieval speed slower to compensate for the lower gpm so you get enough water on the crop. 

Check out Nelson reels and guns."
Farmland prices diverge at the border,"If they wanted a Canadian example they coulda looked here. Our lands trading for around 7500-10000 depending on quality and which neighbours are fighting. Across the river in Québec it’s 3000-5000. Part of it is land quality. They run more to sand and sour ground the bigger part is government policy and language. The religious and language laws mean the Mennonites don’t move there and the laws restricting who can buy land means no one moves from here over to there. Our land took a hell of a jump when guys moved up from southern Ontario they don’t seem to get the same jump from people coming from the Montreal area. The interprovincial barriers on vets and other services really restricts  access and that cuts down on land demand even more. Land quality wise they can’t get guys to drain land unless they have Quebec qualifications either so you either are big enough to have your own rig, on the wait list for there to be enough jobs that justify the French guys from down below to come up or it just doesn’t get done."
Looking for a tractor,"I never understand why the replies to these posts are always new from your closest dealer. I would never so much as consider new when you can get twice the tractor for half the money used, especially in the case of hobby farming. Is everyone afraid of basic maintenance? It's very easy to learn the common issues and what to check for on any specific model you're looking at. Downtime doesn't cost alot when it's 7 goats and a few pigs, its not 3000 acres to seed with rain in the forecast.
If it was me, I'd look at a Ford 5000 or similar, the 4600 -7600 as well as the ten 10 series are excellent and reliable utility tractors.  A massey 275 would get the job done with a Perkins diesel.
Instead of dropping 60k or more on a new 5 series John Deere and eating the expensive early hours depreciation, you could spend 30 on something with 100 hp and a cab and 8 on a backup just as capable but a bit less comfortable then the new deere. Neither of which will depreciate from the hours a hobbyist puts on"

Why not cover crop and no till ,"Where I live we no till because we have to keep moisture in the ground. It’s our biggest limiting factor that contributes to yields. If we tilled we would have a dust bowl and no moisture in fields. 

I can’t speak for other places like Iowa or Minnesota but I would imagine their soils hold moisture so well that they would never get anything planted if they didn’t turn their dirt. Also allows the soil to warm up I’d imagine. When they take off their 200 bushel corn that leaves a lot of residue covering the ground. That would make it basically impossible to get a good stand and even just getting a tractor and planter in the field without it being too wet. Basically the opposite problem we have out west. 

Treating every regions farm ground across the country the same just simply doesn’t work. Climates and soil types limit what can be done. Not saying no till wouldn’t work in the corn belt, but I don’t know. I certainly don’t know better than the guys who have farmed that ground for generations."
Retail Prices at Farmer's Markets,"You will go broke attempting to compete against grocery stores on price alone. You (and anyone selling at a farmers market) should be selling on higher quality and nutrient density, not on price. 

Would a person ever walk in to a Cadillac dealership and complain to them about the price of their vehicles, and that they can go buy a Kia or a Hyundai for a quarter of the price? And would that cause the Cadillac dealer to adjust their prices? 

People will pay more for a higher quality product. If you are growing the produce, you are selling a Cadillac, not a Kia. 

If they want a Kia tomato that tastes more like cardboard that's a tomato, they can go to the grocery store. But if they want a Cadillac tomato that actually has flavor, they can buy it from you. 

Compete on quality, not on price.

If you grew it, you should be getting 20-50% above grocery store prices. You should never be lower than the grocery store. Because you're not selling swill."
Improved vs Unimproved land,"Great inquiry.

1910 Census of Agriculture  
Chapter 9.  
FARMS AND FARM PROPERTY  
See footnote 2 Land in Farms at the bottom of Chapter 9, Page 1 provided below for your convenience.

Land In farms. - Land In farms ls divided at the present census Into (I) improved land, (2) woodland, and (3) all other unimproved land. The same classification was followed in 1880. At former censuses, except that of 1880, farm land was divided Into improved land and unimproved land, woodland being included with unimproved land. Improved land includes all land regularly tilled or mowed, land pastured and cropped in rotation, land lying fallow, land in gardens, orchards, vineyards, and nurseries, and land occupied by farm buildings. Woodland Includes all land covered with natural or planted forest trees which produce, or later may produce, firewood or other forest products. All other unimproved land includes brush land, rough or stony land, swamp land, and any other land which Is not  improved or In forest. It should be noted, however, in this connotation that the Census classification of farm land as ""improved land,'' ""woodland,'' and ""other unimproved land"" is one not always easy for the farmers or enumerators to make, owing to the fact that the farmers sometimes use these terms with different meanings from those assigned to them by the Bureau of the Census. There Is evidence that the same kind of land has at certain times and places been reported as ""Improved land'' and at other times and places as"" unimproved land,'' rendering these classifications less accurate than the report of total farm acreage and  value."

Would love to see what they're batting compared to vets in their first 5 years of practice,second 5, or second decade. 

I think previous episodes were chalked up to the price of doing business and that the state had no intentions of pressing the matter.  As you say, they fcked around for more than a decade and found out.  We'll see where this one goes.  How much money do they have to throw at it, really."

Why they would try to compete with Wal-Mart and have 3 aisles dedicated to dog and cat foot and toys I cannot comprehend.  

I'm afraid they'll be out of business in a few years then I'll be really screwed."
Wanting to get into agriculture ,"I’ll share a little of my background. Grew up a city kid and hated it but couldn’t really find a way out of the city. I got really into hunting and through that learned a tiny bit about ag. Basically what crop fields whitetails, pheasants and geese preferred. With some guidance from a mentor in ag who also had a similar background, I learned you don’t have to inherit a family farm to work in ag. At 25 I went back to school and got the change of scenery I needed at an Oregon community college with a small ag program. I transferred to Oregon State and got a BS in agronomy. I’ve now been working in the ag world 15 years, and as an agronomist for 11 of those, first in seed production and now precision ag. I met lifelong best friends in college, we helped each other kick ass in school and we all have been working in agronomy. Our group chat has potato disease pictures, wheat yields, soil temperatures, all kinds of things we bounce off each other. I’m not rich and I don’t have my own farm but I also still love hunting in October and November and fishing in April and May, which many farmers don’t have the time for. So that’s what I did, anyone with the motivation can do the same. You may go a different route or end up in a different field, that’s more than ok, but if you want to work in agriculture I recommend a bachelors degree. I use my degree every day and it has opened pretty much all the doors I’ve had in front of me. Plenty of people could have ended up in the same spot as me with no college, but without growing up around it I needed it. So I’m very pro-ag school!"
Do you think you’ll be able to keep up with future technology?,"You don't always have to upgrade tech. You can't still grow a good crop with yesterday's tech.

And when I can afford it, it will be yesterday's tech again.  My crops are just as big as the next guys with newer stuff.


You are also much more equipped to use the new tech vs what your grandpa was.  Technology is ever changing and upgrading around you everyday and you have access to Google."

Do I need a license or something related to that to raise chicken for myself as food on my property? I live in Canada,Chickens for personal use aren’t covered under the marketing boards in Ontario so no licence required. You can raise 300 meat birds per year or have up to 100 laying hens. You can sell eggs but to sell meat birds they’d have to be killed at an inspected plant
Small Flower Farm - Machinery Decision,"You need to look at the ROI to see if buying is worth it. Don’t forget maintenance costs. Also make sure to consider everything you will and won’t do with the equipment if you buy it. There are probably a lot more things you will use a good tractor for than you can think of.

She hadn't had a calf for a few seasons but she earned her winter hay many times over by making every move easy. I still miss her."
Christmas Tree Farm,"Lot of work. Lot of issues but it can pay. You’ve gotta have a market and be able to compete with big growers and big box stores bringing them in by the rail car load. Many people think Christmas trees are an easy “plant and come back in 7 years and collect money” deal but that’s not the case. Like all farming it’s a lot of work with nutrient, irrigation and pest issues. You should turn the bulk of a crop in 6 to 7 years.

NJ Used Tractors ,"Used equipment os sky high in price and especially so here in the Northeast. There simply are not as many farms around so less equipment up for sale. What does go for sale is at a premium if in good shape. 

You need to define smaller end. For some people that means under 200hp and for others it’s 10hp. Depending on what features you want you might need to expand your search area. What you intend to farm and the land you have will guide your choice. 

Whatever you buy make sure to inspect it well mechanically  and test drive for function testing. It is well worth the cost of paying a mechanic for a inspection if you are not certain of your ability to inspect it. 

General guidelines. Avoid “spray can overhauls”, if it has real low hours and looks like crap, it’s been beat and pass it up. I’d rather buy high hours and good maintenance. A ROPS cab is a good thing, especially if you have no tractor experience."

Culling logistics,"Culling to me means removing unproductive animals. They are absolutely worth money to be sold as slaughter animals. Why would I sell them to a neighbor if I can get more at the sale barn?

If I am culling them then I don't want anyone to buy them except a processor. There is a reason I am culling them. I absolutely do not want my neighbors buying them as I would not want them to sell me an unproductive animal.

  
Culled cattle get sold as 'pound' cows and are sent to a packer almost immediately.

  
If you are talking about putting an animal down and confusing it with 'culling' then you are barking up the wrong tree with these questions. There are very few times I would put an animal down and let anyone eat it. The only relevant times would be a broken leg and I could get it killed and processed immediately."

Thought you guys would find this cool,"Timely.  I signed up for 2 acres of CRP pollinator habitat this summer.  Will sow in wildflowers and grasses this fall.  I see it as a win-win.  The areas I'll be changing were a little close to my good fishing pond so was considering changing anyway, and CRP will pay me to do it.

On this same topic, for years I would mow around the edges of my hay fields after haying to make the farm look pretty.  Then I learned about how the quail need a place to hide after haying and, of course how the elimination of milkweeds has damaged Monarch butterfly populations.

So for about the last 5 years I have been leaving patches of milkweeds standing in corners, and other places they aren't hurting anything.  This summer I have seen more Monarch butterflies around the farm than I had for a long time.  Took a while, but apparently it works.

About 3 years ago I started leaving more 'borders' of tall grass around the edge of the hay field between the field and the trees.  Maybe 20 feet or so.  I'm now seeing a few quail when I drive around.  Of course, I also know that coyotes and raccoons are the quails biggest enemies, but so far just leaving them more places to hide seems to be working.

I should add that I still mow one 8' trip around all the crop fields all summer as those damn waterhemp that are at the edge of the sprayer thrive there.  So regular mowing them before they go to seed sure seems to help keep that crap out of the crop fields.

I try to be a conservation minded farmer, and so far just a little change here and there seems to be paying off."
Just hoping there are more dairy farmers here then crop farmers...,"I grew up on a dairy farm and worked on the farm while I went to college. After I started my first real non farm job I had a panic attack my first weekend “off” my entire life up to that point, I always had to do something every day and for the first time in my life I had nothing to do."
I think I found my soul goat.,Wife and I got into very small scale goat farming and this is one of the newest additions. He was born one week ago. He's recently decided that inside my coat is the best place in the world.

dumb joke,"Farmer from Kentucky was walking down the road with a bag of chickens. A farmer from Indiana walks by and says “Whatcha got there? Chickens? How many?”. Kentucky says “Tell ya what Hoosier, if you can guess how many I have, I’ll give you both of em.”"

Update: Thieves Caught on Camera Stealing from Mortality Compost Bins,"[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/19fa0px/somebody_is_rifling_through_my_mortality/) Had a chance to review the trail camera footage and I caught two seperate groups stealing chickens from the compost bins.

The first group was three men, they arrived around 5pm. Once inside the yard they noticed the camera and quickly hid their faces, they then turned the camera away from the shed and looted the bin. When they were done they turned the camera back in the hopes that I wouldn't notice. [Video here.](https://youtu.be/Bt9dxz7z67o)

The second group was three women, they came around 6:45pm. They didn't notice the camera and so you can see them sorting through the chickens looking for the freshest ones to take. [Video here.](https://youtu.be/3I9AC74IeO4)

Besides the humans we also had yellow billed kites, woolly necked storks, and lots of stray dogs scavening in the bins. [Video here.](https://youtu.be/Rc8AnAIgxfo)

We have managed to identify five out of the six people involved and all are from the neigbhouring tribal area. We have sent word to the local induna (headman) and hopefully he will deal with the matter - unfortunatley the police are unlikely to take any action on this. As an added precaution we have also sprayed the chickens with a nontoxic blue marker dye to warn any unsuspecting people that these chickens are not fit for human consumption. We did however tell our staff to ""spray the poison"" (""faka amapoison"") and have locked it up in the chemical store - so hopefully the word spreads quickly, although I do not know how long this ruse will last."
Amazing tool for harvesting wheat..,No worries of not being in shape.

Taking what nature gives us, putting in the effort and knowledge, and feeding your family and others.

I'm always amazed when folks ask why anyone would want to be a farmer.  What's more cool than watching the literal fruits of your labor ripen in front of you?

Of course, getting to work outdoors much of the time and the really cool tools and machinery are a bonus too."

"Four years ago I lost my dad, five days ago would have been his 50th birthday. Today I turned 29. This is my first crop that I am about to combine this AM. It was a good day.

There’s a disconnect between maker and taker,"I have mixed feelings about things like this.  On the one hand,  I'd like people to stop actively shitting on us.  That includes everything from the animal rights crowd,  to the environmentalists,  to the 'Huh huh, farmers is dum' set. 

On the other hand,  there's a few people who take it too far the other way into hero worship.   And seemingly a vocal portion of the ag community that think we deserve it.  I don't need to be thanked for my service.  Just let me farm. 

Oh,  and stop complaining about food prices.  It's mostly not on the farm end."

Cousin lost his father in a tractor accident earlier this year. Neighbors banded together to finish field before snow (news story in comments).,"beautiful, i had a tragic funeral today. my dairy farmer neighbor died of a heart attack last Wednesday. me and all fellow farmers gathered at the church for the funeral with all our tractors (71 in total) as if to support the family. it was beautiful and came as a complete surprise to the family.

Problems with buying direct from farmers is butcher capacity... I have to make an appointment for butcher a year in advance... hard to tell that far out if the date is right.

First corn crop,But you grew a skittle! Too bad it's a yellow one.
never knew that farming was this unprofitable and hard,"You sell the exact same product as everybody else, so the only way to make money is to produce more of it.

That’s without the cost of machinery and the interest on loans that are typically required to purchase machinery and land."

"Do men even want to be a smaller scale farmer at all? I keep finding big farmer/ing topics ,but none of the smaller regenerative farming fans that are actually male. Would be interesting to get an opinion.","I am a small scale farmer focused on regenerative agriculture and biodynamic farming and it is extremely tricky to turn a profit. I think in general many farmers are open to the idea regardless of sex, but the costs and risks of transitioning play a large factor in why people choose not to. There’s a Regenerative Agriculture Podcast on Spotify that I enjoy listening to and the guests he has on the show don’t seem to be primarily one sex or the other so I never quite noticed what you are seeing and most, if not all, of the organic farmers in my area are male. There’s also a great permaculture farm not far from us (they do a lot of garlic) also a guy running it.

"No cow needed: Oat and soy can be called milk, FDA proposes",Yeah but it's not milk. Good ol regulatory capture at work
I just don’t understand these people.,"I'm not sure if you have something similar in the U.S but in Australia we grade our soils from 1 to 5 with 1 being able to grow potatoes year on year and never degrade the soils and 5 being unsuitable for any agricultural activity except maybe goats. From that only 15% of Australia's land mass is suitable for cropping, 60 odd percent is suitable for grazing animals and the remaining unsuitable. Cows take an energy source with zero nutritional value to us (grass) and convert it into a highly nutritional energy source, either milk or beef. These statistics make people think that you can just swap pasture for intensive cropping to feed the world. I run 4500Ha and of that only 400Ha is deemed suitable for irrigated cropping. Another 300Ha can handle the occasional dryland fodder crop or cereal with a 5 year pasture break in between. 500Ha is under various degrees of conservation because if grazed too intensely I get sand blows and risk permanent degradation and at least that way I make some money from it. The remainder requires careful pasture management for sheep and cattle. I'd love to crop the lot and make some serious money but the place would be an irreparable dessert within 5 years if I did."

"If you broke up a massive corporate farm into smaller plots, would it be more profitable overall?","Labor is a huge cost in US agriculture. That’s one reason why US farms tend to be heavily mechanized, which in turn makes it more cost effective to farm ever larger plots. The trend towards larger farms has been exacerbated by federal policies and programs encouraging farm expansion over the last century.

Relatively few people in the US have shown an interest in the kind of hard, physical work for small cash payoffs that those Asian small farmers experience."
My fiancé and I are looking to purchase land and then lease it out to a dairy farm/meat farm/produce farm or all three.,"Unfortunately for the farmer to be profitable, you won’t be getting what might feel fair to you. You can usually look up cash rent prices for different states and regions. Out here in Indiana cash rent is around 200 /acre/year. That would be less than the payment on the land if it was financed ($7k per acre to buy). That’s for commercial row crow farming though. Pasture rent is usually even lower. Small scale organic farming may be a little different as they usually have a little higher margins. 

You also want to create a partnership where the farmer is improving the land. There is a cost to this, and they need to know they will be involved for the long term for it to be worth their money and effort to improve soil quality and invest in infrastructure (fencing, water, etc). 

I think you’ll need to come to terms with the fact that while renting the farm may partially subsidize your cost for the land, unless you farm it yourself, it will not pay for it, and it won’t make you money. Land value is always increasing though, so in the long term you’ll be good, as long as you can cash flow the payments in the short term."

Is a carbon-negative beef production system possible?,"Carbon neutral bison was a thing over a long time-scale but there was millions of acres and no mass market for the meat (except at the very end). I think it’s virtually impossible to be carbon negative or even neutral when you are bringing feed from offsite, or using a lot of inputs to produce feed onsite. The way beef is produced today I don’t see how you can do it."

Now on to social issues

I consider myself a centrist so while I understand the pro life argument I'm pro choice solely as a means of humane population control

As for LGBT rights I don't oppose same sex marriage in the eyes of the government as that's a legal contract for tax and law purposes and should be equal for everyone but Religion I don't care what they do as long as it's not enforceable by law

I don't care if you're transitioning to become a man or woman because it's in your right to do so and doesn't affect me but I do not believe tax dollars should be used for hormone therapy or reassignment surgery

I really don't oppose anyone's lifestyle but to be completely honest in my opinion about transgenderism (especially youth) I believe it to be a form of depression which the person feels that becoming the opposite sex will better their lives and should be recognized as a specific mental illness

Have you ever known a trans person completely happy with their life before transition even in a supportive environment? How many do you know that are happier after transition?

My biggest fear is the social pressures on our youth who may feel if they don't fit a specific letter in an acronym they'll be viewed as anti trans or not amongst the cool kids

I'm not against you specifically for your life choices or beliefs and have just given you my honest opinion

I'm open for dialogue with you and applaud you for getting a differing opinion instead of just following the movement from your sides perspective"

I live in Canada,Chickens for personal use aren’t covered under the marketing boards in Ontario so no licence required. You can raise 300 meat birds per year or have up to 100 laying hens. You can sell eggs but to sell meat birds they’d have to be killed at an inspected plant
How College Students Are Being Misled About ‘Sustainable’ Agriculture,This article comments negatively on the greenhouse gas byproducts of composting then goes on to advocate for the use of cover crops.

He says there's going to be people in third world countries starving to death.  There are *already* people starving to death.  Higher food prices certainly aren't going to decrease starvation.

$8.3B in crop insurance payouts to South Dakota farmers: A cost of climate change,"Not a lot of money really. This article kinda shows how clueless the general public is with regards to the amount of money is involved in the ag industry.

Hooray for Factory Farming: It's is good for the environment and it feeds people too.,"I don't think you can call it sustainable if all you do is decrease soil loss and decrease carbon emissions. It's a start, but if that's the best industrial agriculture can do, we should probably keep exploring alternatives. A perennial based system that uses livestock instead of oil for fertilizer has the potential to build soil and sequester carbon. That's what I'd call sustainable. We should probably focus more energy on that type of food production. It doesn't even have to be small and labor intensive. We can find ways to do it on an industrial scale. We can keep making our system of feeding annual crops to animals on concrete more efficient but it will never be sustainable. We need to start moving in a slightly different direction."

Industrial agriculture is already shifting into regenerative far faster than hobby farming 

On my industrial factory farm of 2,000 acres monocrop corn/soybeans i use no till and cover crops which eliminated my use of Glyphosate 

The cover crops also winter feed my cattle plus baling some on the Organic Rye I sell to animal sanctuaries and agrotourist farms because they pay higher for mid quality organic 

Even my factory cattle are pasture raised using regenerative Rotational grazing which has me grazing more cattle per acre and still brings back plant and wildlife diversity 

One pasture I run 100 head on 60 acres without overgrazing 

I always get a laugh at articles written by people with zero agriculture experience that believe Monsanto still runs the industrial farm game when in reality we're like Bayer who also heals what they destroyed 

More and more large farms are shifting into regenerative agriculture but nobody from these reporters is willing to talk about that"
How many chicken do i need to eat one every day?,Kind of depends on where you live. If you’re in a southern climate you can spread out 50 chickens in batches through the year pretty easily I’d think.

What the hell does macro land management issues have to do with climate change in this sense?

&#x200B;

>The researchers also recommended increasing our reliance on alternative proteins such as fungi, algae, or insects

Rapid adoption of fungi and algae for mass consumption purposes would require invoking that dirty acronym, *GMO*.  And growing insects in lieu of traditional meat sources would require approximately the same amount of biomass input as the animals they replace.  They're not magical protein creation machines.

&#x200B;

>The researchers assume that we’ll come up with a new technological way  to increase fruit and vegetable yields 1 percent over the next 50  years—which is still a long way off from the 8 percent they suggest

Ok, so they're basing all of this on a combination of mystic fortune telling and static land usage, and obviously aren't taking into account newer methods such as warehouse/vertical farming for produce which larger cities will absolutely need, not just to supply the demand but also to circumvent increasing gridlock and distribution issues.

What you're seeing in this video is not common, and is more of bad farming practices.

In poultry production the more dry that you can keep the birds the more healthy that they will be.  Mr. Watts is responsible for maintaining an environment that is conducive to healthy chicken production, and from what it sounds like he's not complying with standard growing practices that are outlined in ever poultry production contract.     

If the buildings are overheating, that's on him, in his AMA he stated he hasnt changed his litter for 4 years, why?  This is a bad business decision on many levels, that litter has immense value as fertilizer, in my area is worth up to $35/ton, which would more than pay for new shavings or ricehulls for litter and leave him with cash left over.  Reusing litter for 4 years is detrimental to the bird's health, and I am very doubtful that Perdue would sign off on that.  

From looking at the video, he's got a litter problem, a moisture problem, and from the sounds of it a ventilation problem, and most likely his contract was in jeopardy because of his poor practices and he wanted to make Perdue look like the badguy.

What do you think of small farmers?,"As an economist,  you will appreciate how the general rules of economics, capitalism, and the economies of scale appy to individual operations. 

The more subtle economic issues that you allude to relate to the labor force pipeline and supply chain issues. 

First, as smaller operations get pushed out of the industry, they take the next generation of farmers, farm laborers, farm spouses and specialized support industry personnel with them. When there are not enough ag kids, we lose the future bankers, farm mechanics, crop insurers, and researchers. One thing that I have seen is that farm people are generally considered to be unskilled by labor researchers, but farm skills translate well into the broader economy while the broader economy skills do not translate back into the specialized farm economy very well.

Second is that all of the support industries and suppliers require a certain scale to remain viable. When the number of farm operations gets to small because a very few large operations have swallowed the smaller ones, then these other businesses go away, undermining the sustainability of the farm operations that remain. Although it is not farm specific, think about how a barber or doctor needs to have a minimum population in the service area to remain in business. 

Finally, don't overlook the human social needs of farmers and rural people in general. Economists don't often worry about this topic, but many communities seem to be shrinking below sustainable population levels, even if the acres remain in ag production--for now."

If you aren't sure how to take care of them, then you might not be providing a sanctuary.  The only affordable way to take care of them is to turn them out on grass and feed good hay in the winter.  The amount of land needed to graze them depends on your location and condition of your pasture.   Where I live, it requires 8 to 10 acres per animal, so around here, you would need 24 to 30 acres.

"Systematic discrimination, intimidation, and racism towards black farmers","The US sugar cane industry has been struggling for decades. living almost entirely off of government subsidies to compete with other countries prices. He didn't lose his farm because he was black he lost it because the industry as a whole is faltering. Other things chain around the steering wheel, even if they did that it would be little more than a minor inconvenience. Mud stuffed into hydraulic lines... no way someone would go through the trouble of cracking lines pouring dirt in them and re installing them when you could just cut the lines and be done with it. Draining the engine oil... come on even 1960s machines would tell you ask soon as you turned the keep it had no oil pressure. Cinder blocks in the field... okay cool it's  the same as a big rock much better ways to fuck something up like wire in the cane. Shot at tractors... okay I could believe that would happen but why would someone try all the other sneaky things listed but just end up shooting them why not just start with that. Also how the hell do you not catch someone repeatedly doing this stuff. You know what they are after and you know where your equipment it's easy bait. Every dairy farmer in the nation is struggling right now and you're trying to cry me these blues."
"No, honeybees aren't dying at record rates. Yes, the media jumps on the hype and magnifies it far worse than it needs to be.","Weird, I can find a lot of reports and studies that suggest the same conclusion - that bees *are* and have been dying at an alarming rate. Capital Research can cherry pick and use misleading information all they want, but the facts present themselves.

>Often terms such as “disappearing disease” or “spring dwindling” are used to describe the syndrome in which large numbers of colonies die in spring due to a lack of adult bees. However in 2007, some beekeepers experienced 80–100% losses.

[Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences](http://agsci.psu.edu/news/radio/2007/dramatic-honey-bee-die-off-worries-beekeepers-and-crop-producers)

>""WE HAVE SEEN INCREDIBLY HIGH LOSSES OF HONEY BEE COLONIES, PARTICULARLY AMONG COMMERCIAL MIGRATORY BEEKEEPERS. WE HAVE ONE BEEKEEPER IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO HAD 12-HUNDRED COLONIES EARLY IN THE YEAR AND NOW HAS 200. WE HAVE A BEEKEEPER WHO MADE UP A NUCLEUS COLONY OF 700 -- 500 OF THOSE WERE DEAD IN THREE MONTHS. SO THEY'RE DRAMATIC."" (sorry about the caps, that's the site - not me)

[Congressional Research Service](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33938.pdf)

>Honey bee colony losses are not uncommon. However, losses in recent years differ from past situations in that colony losses are occurring mostly because bees are failing to return to the hive (which is largely uncharacteristic of bee behavior); bee colony losses have been rapid; colony losses are occurring in large numbers; and the reason(s) for these losses remains largely unknown. 

[USDA - CCD Steering Committee](https://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/ccd/ccdprogressreport2010.pdf)

>After the large-scale, unexplained losses of managed U.S. honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies during the winter of 2006-2007, investigators identified a set of symptoms that were termed colony collapse disorder (CCD). In response to this problem, Federal and State government, university, and private researchers, led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (now the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)), mobilized to define an approach to CCD, an effort resulting in formation of the CCD Steering Committee, and publication of the CCD Action Plan in July 2007. Many organizations, public and private, in addition to those represented on the Steering Committee, are involved in the work to address the CCD problem.

My only assumption here, is that the CRC is misrepresenting the data because funds were allocated to address the issue. They ""oppose the growth of government-welfare programs and promotes private sector alternatives. It discourages donations by corporations to non-profits supporting what it sees as anti-business or liberal policies."" They simply don't want the money to be spent on this and are choosing to act like it isn't happening. "
The High Price of Cheap Meat: Shocking Animal Cruelty,"As soon as I realized this was a rolling stone article I should have stopped reading... alas I kept reading. I hate this article because it provides no insightful solutions rather it just attacks meat. They discuss a few horrible stories and then fill the article with bloody pictures and figures of how many cow/pigs/chickens are killed in the US each year like these are somehow correlated. People that torture animals are disgusting human beings and should be prosecuted. Considering the number of animals consumed in the US every year compared to these animal cruelty cases their occurrence is quite low, much lower than violent human on human crime. In the US we consume a shit ton of meat, probably too much but as a result we have developed a very industrialized system for producing meat which includes cold steel enclosures (gosh), cattle prods (Oh No!) and death! This article makes it seem that nothing is regulated and that couldn't be further from the truth. The USDA has people where their entire job is to evaluate how certain devices and holding facilities will emotionally effect animals. These people actually get on their hands and knees and crawl through facilities. As for the GAG laws, they are completely reasonable. First of all these are private facilities and are regulated and observed by the USDA officials, to allow animal rights activists the ability to film and observe is ludicrous. These people are fundamentally against the killing of animals and all they want is a shot of an animal hanging up getting its throat slit. Yes, death involves blood but processing facilities have this down to a science to where the animals feel virtually no pain. If the animal did feel pain or was overly stressed it can drastically lesson the quality of the meat. Not every animal can be walked out to an open meadow, have candles lit and then quietly allowed to slip into their passing. I could go on here but the point is these people don't think we should be killing animals for food, period. Radical articles like this confuse and misinform people who have no understanding of the process and fail to inform about the real problems or opportunities facing our food system. 

I grew up working on a natural beef ranch/farm where cows were not feed hormones or antibiotics and were raised humanely. I believe in this system because it produces delicious beef, is an important part of a larger producing farm and its just the right way to do things. I believe our current food system is really screwed up for a whole host of reason. After the industrialization of agriculture (new farm equipment, synthetic fertilizer, nitrogen, pesticides etc) our food system boomed and allowed farmers to greatly expand and specialize their operations. Soon whole areas of the country specialized in one agricultural product and a massive national integrated food system emerged. Our massive national food system has many problems. Massive one-dimensional farms are not environmentally sustainable. Monocropping only works because we have synthetic fertilizers, nitrogen and pesticides but these are proven to have negative effects on our water and soil quality. As soil quality continues to decrease our dependence on these chemicals increase. Farms used to be multidimensional because they had to be. They needed to raise livestock to fertilize their fields and they needed to plant multiple crops and rotate crops to control pests and enhance soil quality. The other problem is that with people so far removed from farming and food production they don't stop to think about what goes into their bodies. I believe that more local food production will help expose people to healthier foods and reward farmers for producing a variety of agricultural products. The problem right now is that their aren't enough systems in place to help them sell this food. People need to actively seek out local foods and restaurants that utilize local foods. If you think that our meat needs to be free range or local go find it! I personally think it will be impossible to rid ourselves completely of industrialized agriculture - too many people care only about price and convenience. There will never be enough local food to feed Manhattan or Detroit but there can be alternatives. "

I don’t think they’re inherently better, either. If anything, they’re less predictable and definitely less efficient. Plants take up nutrients in ion (or molecular in the case of boron) constituents. It doesn’t matter a bit what the source of NH4+, H2PO4-, or Mg2+ is.

The space you've given them sounds like it may be too small for 3 cows, assuming they're full grown. They're probably making noise because that's what cattle do, or because they're unhappy. 

As far as your pasture, they could probably be out there enjoying it if you built a proper fence. ""We tried and they keep getting out"" is nothing more than an excuse, and a poor one at that. If that were an acceptable answer there would be millions of cows everywhere running free all the time. Build a better fence and these questions and problems would go away."

Farmers Say GMO Corn No Longer Resistant to Pests,"I looked into this a bit more, before heading off to bed:

Turns out the bug developing resistance is specifically the [Fall armyworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_armyworm). So, saying ""pests"" is a little bit alarmist. 

I think what helped contribute to the onset of resistance, whether or not refuge requirements were complied with, is the fact that Brazillian farmers can/do double crop corn *(within a single season). Within this system, there seems to have been an over-reliance on Cry1F expression; rather than [also] using corn with Cry1Aa, Cry1Ba and Cry2Aa (or Vip3Aa for that matter).

Fall Armyworm resistance [to Cry1F] has been known about since 2006, and has [been researched](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=entomologydiss) a fair bit now.

If you can use sources that are more balanced for the N and K (i.e. broiler or turkey manure instead of layer) or just straight S of K + chilean + mircros normal cropping will eventually bring your P into safe range. Cover crops love P, worms love cover crops. Worm casings have good AS only in as much as you add, worms will improve your soil's AS continuously. Lime isn't P. Buffering isn't changing your pH.

Aquaponics: A sustainable solution,">The aquaponic system has a number of advantages.  For the fish, all that is required is the periodic top-up of water levels to offset losses to evaporation and transpiration.

To feed the plants, waste from feeding fish is inexpensive compared to hydroponic nutrient solutions and does not rely on the over-mining of essential nutrients.

Denmark Raises Antibiotic-Free Pigs. Why Can’t the U.S.?,"We do.

No in feed antibiotics or animal byproducts. We only use antibiotics on a rare occasion on a per animal basis and those pigs are then identified with a tag and segregated from the rwa pigs so we can ship them as conventional instead. It's extra work, lower growth rates but there is a premium involved for the work. Thing is, customers need to seek out and buy RWA labeled pork then, not just what's cheapest, or else any of these programs will just fail. People demand all this shit from livestock farmers but when it comes time to vote with their wallets they still just look for the best deal instead.

Farm that doesn't mess with insects or other small animals?,"Let's put it this way no matter what you plant and care for will have a compounding affect on the entire microbiome

If You're worried about harming insects then what about the millions of microbes in the soil that you will affect too

Let's say you had an area full of tall grass weeds and one young but sickly tree so you decide to mow off the grass take out the tree and plant a vegetable garden 

Even without tillage or stump removal You're still changing the ecology of the microbiome affecting millions of species of bacteria insects and even the animals that relied upon that one spot not to mention the plants too that prevented weed seeds from emerging 

Placing plastic for weed suppressing kills biodiversity under the plastic and a greenhouse or other facility would be even more harmful due to construction and an artificial environment created to grow specific plants

If you're worried about harming insects I suggest you look a the entire Holistic Context of your garden area and determine how much life you plan to destroy to grow life continuing food for humans 

There's always a trade off in agriculture wit cascading and compounding effects to the local ecosystem
